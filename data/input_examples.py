It has a rich set of higher-level tools, including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data processing, pandas API on Spark for pandas workloads, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Structured Streaming for incremental computation and stream processing. Apache Spark is capable of handling large-scale data processing, machine learning, and data analytics, making it a unified analytics engine."""},

They enable the distribution of computation on worker CPUs or GPUs, making it possible to scale Python code and models to large datasets. By using Pandas UDFs, you can leverage the parallel processing capabilities of Spark to speed up computations, similar to using PySpark or other parallelization libraries like TorchDistributor. This approach is particularly useful for tasks like machine translation, where a pre-trained model can be wrapped in a Pandas UDF and executed on a Spark cluster, utilizing available GPUs for accelerated computation."""},
